# My Web App

This is a web app designed to help students learn how to use queries in databases. It provides a prefix database using SQL to practice querying and manipulating data.

## Project Structure

The project has the following file structure:

- `docs/index.html`: The main HTML file for the web app. It contains the structure and content of the web pages.
- `docs/css/styles.css`: The CSS file for the web app. It is used to customize the appearance of the web pages.
- `docs/js/main.js`: The JavaScript file for the web app. It adds interactivity and functionality to the web pages.
- `docs/sql/database.sql`: The SQL file for the prefix database. It contains the queries to create and manipulate the database tables and data.
- `tests/test.js`: The JavaScript file for testing the functionality of the web app. It ensures that the app behaves as expected.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies the files and directories that should be ignored by Git version control.
- `package.json`: The configuration file for npm. It lists the dependencies and scripts for the project.

## Getting Started

To get started with the web app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Set up the prefix database by executing the queries in `docs/sql/database.sql`.
4. Open `docs/index.html` in a web browser to access the web app.

## Usage
